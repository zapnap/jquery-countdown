# jQuery Countdown

Yet another simple jQuery countdown plugin. The others were either
overly complicated or just didn't do what I needed. So I wrote one. It
took 10 minutes. And it's for you. For Christmas.

## Usage

Start the countdown.

    $('#countdown').countdown({
      seconds  : 10,
      callback : function() { alert("Blast Off! Up to the stars we go."); }
    });

There's some other stuff you can do too. Check the source. The source
always knows.
